    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Delicious Butter Chicken recipe optimized for ease of use with an Instant Pot.</p>
    <p>Butter Chicken a recent recipe I learned with my Instant Pot and is now one of my favorites.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>14oz can tomatoes</li>
        <li>5-6 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1-2 tsps minced ginger</li>
        <li>1 tsp turmeric</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 pound boneless skinless chicken breast <em>if frozen add 1-2 minutes to cook time</em></li>
        <li>To Finish:</li>
        <li>4oz (one stick) butter cut into cubes</li>
        <li>4oz heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place all ingredients into an Instant Pot in the order listed, EXCEPT for the butter, cream and 1 teaspoon of the garam masala, mixing the sauce well before you place the chicken on top of the sauce. If it's frozen, push it into the sauce a bit so it defrosts better</li>
        <li>Close the cooker and set for 10 mins on high, and let it release pressure naturally for 10 minutes. After that, release all remaining pressure. </li>
        <li>Open up the pot and remove the chicken carefully and set aside</li>
        <li>Blend together all the ingredients, preferably using an immersion blender</li>
        <li>Add the cut up butter, cream, cilantro, and garam masala and stir until well incorporated.</li>
        <li>It's best to let the sauce cool just a little before adding the butter and the cream. Adding it into the boiling sauce will make your sauce very thin. If that happens, just put it in the fridge for a little and let it thicken up. It should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon</li>
        <li>Take out half the sauce and freeze for later or store in the fridge for 2-3 days</li>
        <li>Add the chicken back in and heat through. Break it up into smaller pieces if you need but don't shred it.</li>
        <li>Serve over basmati rice</li>
    </ol>
